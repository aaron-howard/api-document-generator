# API Documentation Generator Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy & Truth (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Documentation MUST reflect the actual behavior of the API—no stale or misleading examples.
Every endpoint MUST include request/response schemas, error codes, and usage examples.
Generated content MUST be validated against source code, specs, or annotations for correctness.

Rationale: Inaccurate documentation breaks developer trust and wastes time debugging discrepancies.

### II. Privacy & Security (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Never expose sensitive data, secrets, or internal-only endpoints in generated documentation.
Documentation visibility MUST match API access levels and respect existing access controls.
All inputs and outputs MUST be sanitized to prevent injection attacks or data leakage in rendered content.

Rationale: Security vulnerabilities in documentation can compromise entire systems and violate compliance requirements.

### III. Developer Experience First
Fast setup with minimal configuration—zero-config MUST work for common use cases.
Live preview and hot reload MUST be provided for documentation changes during development.
CLI and programmatic APIs MUST be intuitive, composable, and scriptable.

Rationale: Developer adoption depends on frictionless onboarding and efficient workflows.

### IV. Consistency & Clarity
Use consistent formatting, naming conventions, and terminology across all generated outputs.
Support multiple input formats (OpenAPI, JSDoc, TypeScript, GraphQL, etc.) with standardized output.
Maintain canonical glossary terms and avoid ambiguous synonyms across documentation.

Rationale: Inconsistent documentation creates confusion and increases cognitive load for API consumers.

### V. Extensibility & Customization
Support custom templates, themes, and branding for generated documentation.
Enable plugin architecture for pre-processing, post-processing, and third-party integrations.
Allow developer overrides and refinements of AI-generated content for accuracy and tone alignment.

Rationale: One-size-fits-all documentation fails to meet diverse organizational needs and brand requirements.

### VI. Performance & Scalability
Handle large codebases and complex APIs without performance degradation.
Cache intelligently to avoid redundant parsing or rendering operations.
Optimize output size and load time for hosted documentation portals.

Rationale: Poor performance blocks adoption for enterprise-scale APIs and creates poor user experiences.

### VII. Interoperability & Integration
Output formats MUST include HTML, Markdown, PDF, and embeddable widgets.
Integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, version control, and changelog systems.
Support localization and internationalization for global development teams.

Rationale: Documentation tools must fit into existing workflows rather than requiring workflow changes.

### VIII. Testing & Auditability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Validate input specifications and flag inconsistencies or missing metadata before generation.
Provide diffing tools to compare documentation versions across commits or releases.
Log all generation steps for traceability, debugging, and compliance auditing.

Rationale: Untested documentation generation leads to broken outputs and reduces confidence in automated systems.

### IX. AI-Assisted Intelligence
Use AI to generate concise, human-readable summaries of complex endpoints, schemas, and workflows.
AI summaries MUST highlight purpose, usage patterns, and edge cases without oversimplifying technical details.
Support AI summarization across multiple levels: endpoint, service, module, and release.

Rationale: AI can accelerate documentation creation while maintaining human oversight for accuracy.

### X. Change Detection & Versioning
Automatically detect and document changes in API structure, behavior, or metadata across versions.
Generate semantic diffs showing added/removed endpoints, modified parameters, and updated response formats.
Support tagging, filtering, and linking changelog entries to commits, issues, or pull requests.

Rationale: API evolution tracking is critical for maintaining backward compatibility and communicating breaking changes.

## Quality Standards

### Output Quality Gates
- All generated documentation MUST pass spell-check and grammar validation
- Examples MUST be executable and produce expected results
- Links MUST be verified and resolve to valid resources
- Generated content MUST maintain consistent voice and technical depth

### Performance Benchmarks
- Initial generation MUST complete within 60 seconds for APIs with <1000 endpoints
- Incremental updates MUST complete within 10 seconds for single endpoint changes
- Generated documentation pages MUST load within 3 seconds on standard connections
- Memory usage MUST not exceed 2GB during generation for typical enterprise APIs

## Development Workflow

### Test-First Development
- All new features MUST have failing tests before implementation begins
- Contract tests MUST verify input specification parsing for all supported formats
- Integration tests MUST validate end-to-end generation workflows
- Performance tests MUST prevent regression in generation speed and memory usage

### Code Review Requirements
- All changes MUST pass automated linting and formatting checks
- Security-sensitive code MUST receive review from at least two maintainers
- Breaking changes MUST include migration guides and deprecation notices
- Documentation changes MUST include example outputs and test cases

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and coding standards.
All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with constitutional principles.
Complexity deviations MUST be explicitly justified and documented in implementation plans.

### Amendment Process
- Constitution changes require consensus from project maintainers
- Major version increments (backward-incompatible changes) require formal approval
- Minor version increments (new principles or expanded guidance) require review period
- Patch version increments (clarifications and fixes) can be applied immediately

### Compliance Review
- Weekly reviews MUST check for constitutional violations in recent changes
- Quarterly audits MUST assess overall adherence to principles and identify improvement areas
- Annual reviews MUST evaluate constitution effectiveness and propose updates
