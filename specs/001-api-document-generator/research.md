# Research: API Document Generator

## Overview
This document captures research findings for key technical decisions and approaches for the API Documentation Generator feature.

## Input Format Parsing Research

### Decision: Multi-Language Parser Strategy
**Rationale**: Support for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and Go requires different parsing approaches due to varying annotation systems and AST structures.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single universal parser (rejected: too complex, poor language-specific support)
- External parser dependencies only (rejected: limited customization)
- Language-specific parsers with unified interface (selected)

### TypeScript/JavaScript Parsing
**Decision**: Use TypeScript Compiler API + JSDoc parsing
**Rationale**: Native TypeScript support with excellent type information extraction and mature JSDoc ecosystem.
**Implementation**: typescript package + doctrine for JSDoc parsing

### Python Parsing
**Decision**: Use ast module + docstring parsing
**Rationale**: Built-in AST parsing with support for various docstring formats (Sphinx, Google, NumPy style).
**Implementation**: ast + pydoc-markdown for docstring extraction

### Go Parsing
**Decision**: Use go/parser + go/doc packages
**Rationale**: Official Go parsing tools with excellent comment and documentation extraction.
**Implementation**: Execute go commands from Node.js/Python runtime

### OpenAPI/GraphQL Parsing
**Decision**: Use swagger-parser for OpenAPI, graphql-js for GraphQL
**Rationale**: Mature, well-maintained libraries with comprehensive validation and schema extraction.

## AI Summarization Research

### Decision: OpenAI GPT-4 with fallback options
**Rationale**: Best-in-class accuracy for technical content with human-like summarization quality.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Local LLMs (rejected: performance constraints, accuracy concerns)
- Multiple AI providers with voting (rejected: complexity, cost)
- OpenAI with Anthropic fallback (selected for reliability)

**Quality Assurance**:
- Template-based prompts for consistency
- Human validation workflows for critical content
- Accuracy scoring based on technical correctness metrics

## Output Format Generation Research

### Decision: Template-based generation with Handlebars
**Rationale**: Flexible templating system supporting multiple output formats with user customization.

**Format Support**:
- **Markdown**: Native generation for version control and editing
- **HTML**: Template-based with CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind)
- **PDF**: HTML-to-PDF conversion using Puppeteer
- **JSON**: Structured data for API consumption and integration

### Theming and Customization
**Decision**: Layered template system with inheritance
**Rationale**: Allows base templates with organization-specific overrides while maintaining consistency.

## Performance and Caching Research

### Decision: Multi-level caching strategy
**Rationale**: Large API specifications require intelligent caching to meet performance targets.

**Caching Layers**:
1. **Parse Cache**: AST and metadata extraction results
2. **Generation Cache**: Rendered documentation components
3. **AI Cache**: Summarization results to avoid repeated API calls
4. **File Watcher**: Incremental updates for changed source files

### Concurrency Management
**Decision**: Worker pool with queue management
**Rationale**: Process multiple requests efficiently while preventing resource exhaustion.

**Implementation**:
- Maximum 3 concurrent generation processes
- Request queuing with priority handling
- Resource monitoring and throttling

## Plugin Architecture Research

### Decision: Hook-based plugin system
**Rationale**: Extensible architecture allowing custom parsers, generators, and post-processors.

**Plugin Types**:
- **Input Plugins**: Custom format parsers
- **Generator Plugins**: Custom output formats
- **Processor Plugins**: Content transformation and enhancement
- **Theme Plugins**: Visual customization and branding

**API Design**:
- Event-driven hooks for lifecycle integration
- Configuration-based plugin loading
- Sandbox execution for security

## CI/CD Integration Research

### Decision: Native integration with major CI/CD platforms
**Rationale**: Seamless integration reduces adoption friction and ensures automated documentation updates.

**Supported Platforms**:
- GitHub Actions (native action)
- GitLab CI (Docker container)
- Jenkins (plugin)
- CircleCI (orb)

**Failure Handling**:
- 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Detailed error reporting and suggestions
- Graceful degradation options

## Security and Privacy Research

### Decision: Role-based access control with content filtering
**Rationale**: Enterprise environments require fine-grained control over documentation visibility.

**Security Measures**:
- Whitelist-based endpoint exposure
- Content sanitization for injection prevention
- Audit logging for compliance requirements
- Configurable access control rules

**Privacy Protection**:
- Sensitive data detection and redaction
- Environment-specific configuration filtering
- Optional on-premises deployment support

## Version Control and Change Detection Research

### Decision: Git-based semantic diffing
**Rationale**: Leverage existing version control for change tracking with intelligent API-aware analysis.

**Change Detection**:
- AST-based comparison for structural changes
- Semantic versioning impact analysis
- Breaking change identification and flagging
- Automated changelog generation with categorization

**Integration Points**:
- Git hooks for automatic updates
- GitHub/GitLab integration for pull request documentation
- Release tag correlation for version tracking

## Deployment and Distribution Research

### Decision: Multi-runtime binary distribution
**Rationale**: Support diverse development environments with native performance.

**Distribution Strategy**:
- Node.js: npm package with optional global installation
- Python: PyPI package with pip installation
- Go: Compiled binaries for major platforms
- Docker: Container images for CI/CD environments

**Configuration Management**:
- Configuration file discovery (docgen.config.json)
- Environment variable support
- CLI argument precedence
- Workspace-specific overrides
