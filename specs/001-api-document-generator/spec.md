# Feature Specification: API Document Generator

**Feature Branch**: `001-api-document-generator`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Automatically generate accurate, readable, and versioned documentation for APIs based on source code, specs, or annotations. Supports multiple input formats and outputs, with AI-assisted summarization and changelog generation."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → ✓ Feature description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → ✓ Identify: developers, documentation generation, API analysis, multi-format support
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → ✓ Clear user flows identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → ✓ Each requirement testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → ✓ API Documentation, Source Code, Configuration entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Ready for validation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: What specific performance target should the system meet when processing large API specifications? → A: Under 5 minutes for 1000+ endpoints
- Q: What should happen when CI/CD pipeline integration fails during documentation generation? → A: Retry 3 times then fail the pipeline
- Q: What technical constraints should guide the choice of implementation technology stack? → A: Must support multiple runtime environments (Node.js, Python, Go)
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent documentation generation requests to prevent resource conflicts? → A: Limit to 3 concurrent requests with queuing
- Q: What measurable criteria should define successful AI summarization quality? → A: Technical accuracy score >90% with readability metrics

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or technical writer, I want to automatically generate comprehensive API documentation from my source code, OpenAPI specs, or code annotations, so that I can maintain accurate, up-to-date documentation without manual effort and provide clear guidance to API consumers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a project with TypeScript source code containing JSDoc comments, **When** I run the documentation generator, **Then** I receive complete API documentation in Markdown format with endpoint descriptions, parameters, and examples.

2. **Given** an OpenAPI specification file with 100+ endpoints, **When** I generate documentation with AI summarization enabled, **Then** I receive human-readable summaries for each endpoint that highlight purpose, usage patterns, and edge cases.

3. **Given** two versions of an API specification, **When** I run changelog generation, **Then** I receive a semantic diff showing added/removed endpoints, modified parameters, and updated response formats.

4. **Given** a documentation generation request with role-based access configuration, **When** the system processes private/internal endpoints, **Then** only whitelisted endpoints appear in the output documentation.

5. **Given** malformed input specifications, **When** the system attempts to process them, **Then** it fails gracefully with detailed error logs and suggestions for correction.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when source code contains conflicting annotations or incomplete documentation?
- How does the system handle very large API specifications (1000+ endpoints) without performance degradation?
- What occurs when Git history is corrupted or incomplete for changelog generation?
- How does the system behave when custom themes or templates contain syntax errors?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST parse multiple input formats including TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go source code with annotations
- **FR-002**: System MUST process OpenAPI specifications in YAML and JSON formats
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate output in multiple formats including Markdown, HTML, PDF, and JSON
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide AI-assisted summarization of endpoints with human oversight capabilities
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate changelogs by comparing API versions and Git commit history
- **FR-006**: System MUST support role-based documentation visibility and access control
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate input specifications and provide clear error messages for malformed data
- **FR-008**: System MUST support localization (i18n) and custom theming
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide plugin architecture for extensible input parsing and output rendering
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with CI/CD pipelines with retry logic (3 attempts) and fail pipeline on persistent failures
- **FR-011**: System MUST never expose private or internal endpoints unless explicitly whitelisted
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow manual override of AI-generated content for accuracy control
- **FR-013**: System MUST support template customization for branding and layout requirements
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide hooks for post-processing and external integrations
- **FR-015**: System MUST flag undocumented or ambiguous API endpoints during generation
- **FR-016**: System MUST support deployment across multiple runtime environments including Node.js, Python, and Go

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST process API specifications with 1000+ endpoints within 5 minutes
- **NFR-002**: Generated documentation MUST be version-controllable and diff-friendly
- **NFR-003**: System MUST fail gracefully on invalid input without data corruption
- **NFR-004**: AI summarization MUST achieve >90% technical accuracy score with measurable readability improvements over source content
- **NFR-005**: Output formats MUST be embeddable in existing documentation portals
- **NFR-006**: System MUST support concurrent processing limited to 3 simultaneous requests with automatic queuing for additional requests

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **API Documentation**: Generated output containing endpoint descriptions, parameters, examples, and metadata with version tracking
- **Source Code**: Input files with annotations, decorators, or comments that describe API behavior and structure
- **Configuration**: User-defined settings for input sources, output formats, themes, access controls, and plugin configurations
- **Specification**: Structured API definitions in OpenAPI, GraphQL, or other standard formats
- **Changelog Entry**: Semantic difference records showing API changes between versions with categorization and impact analysis
- **AI Summary**: Generated human-readable descriptions of API endpoints with purpose, usage patterns, and edge case documentation
- **Template**: Customizable layouts and themes for branding and presentation of generated documentation
- **Plugin**: Extensible components for input parsing, output rendering, and post-processing workflows
